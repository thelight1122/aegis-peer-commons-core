OBS-OPEN PATTERN BRIEF
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CYCLE:               2
DATE:                2026-03-07
PRIOR_CYCLE_OUTCOME: SUCCESS

PATTERN_ALERTS:
  [NONE — All prior patterns resolved in Cycle 1]

HORIZON_WATCHES:

- PATTERN_NAME:      IDS-GATE-INVERSION-REGRESSION
    COUNT:             0
    WATCH_NOTE:        Verify that PEER_CAPTURE remains at the absolute entry point and that IDS logic remains universal across all three proportional paths.

- PATTERN_NAME:      COLOUR-VALENCE-DRIFT-RECURRENCE
    COUNT:             0
    WATCH_NOTE:        Monitor visual indicators in Dashboard.tsx and NebulaMirror.tsx for any re-introduction of hue-based scoring (red/green/purple).

LANGUAGE_DRIFT_WATCH:

- TERM:              'enforce'
    LAST_SEEN_IN:      TECHNICAL.md (Cycle 1)
    WATCH:             Ensure no new documentation or code comments use directive language.

ANTICIPATION_DELTA:

- CONFIRMED:         IDS-GATE-INVERSION, COLOUR-VALENCE-DRIFT (Cycle 1)
- NOT_FOUND:         N/A
- UNEXPECTED:        N/A

BRIEF_FOR_DIAG:
  Cycle 2 shifts focus to architectural stability and security integrity (BM-ARCH/BM-SEC). DIAG should perform a deep scan of the pipeline boundaries to ensure the structural refactor from Cycle 1 hasn't introduced latent regressions or unhandled edge cases in the proportional routing logic. Hold awareness for any "hidden" decision layers that may have emerged during the IDS universalization.
